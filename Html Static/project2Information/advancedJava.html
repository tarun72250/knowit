        <h1>What is Advance JAVA</h1>
            <p>
                Advanced Java is the collection of technologies and tools that enable developers to create dynamic and secure applications, including features such as JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), Servlets, and JSP (JavaServer Page) are being used for generating and making interactive dynamic content, the most important feature of advanced Java is JPA (Java Persistence API), that is used for managing relational databases, Spring Framework that encompasses the modules for dependency injection, Spring MVC Framework, and AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and Spring Security that ensures the authentication, and authorization of the application.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Prerequisites For Learning Advanced Java</h2>
        <p>To learn Advanced Java, itâ€™s important to understand prerequisites thoroughly before deep diving into the more complex topics, as prerequisites will provide a strong foundation for Java, following are some key prerequisites:</p>
        
        <p><ol><li>Core Java Proficiency</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
            <li>Web Development Basics</li>
            <li>Database Fundamentals</li>
            <li>Java Standard Libraries</li>
            <li>Basic Programming Logic</li>
            <li>Understanding of Networking</li></ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Syllabus of Advanced Java:</h4>
        <p>
            <ul><li> Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE): <p>Java Servlets,JavaServer Pages (JSP),JavaServer Faces (JSF),Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)</p></li>
                <li>Concurrency</li>
                <li> Multithreading</li>
                <li>JDBC <p>Load the JDBC driver,Establish a Connection,Creating a Statement,Execute SQL Queries, Process Results,Close Resources,Handle Exceptions</p></li>
                <li>Java Persistence API (JPA)</li>
                <li>Spring Framework <p>The Spring Framework Provides Two Type of Container:
                    Bean Factory is a simple container that provides support for DI.
                    Application Context is built upon the concept of the bean factory container and provides other functionality such as AOP and Internationalisation.</p></li>
                <li>Hibernate<p>Hibernate is a Java Persistence Framework. Persistence is the availability of the object/data even after the process that created it,is terminated.

                    There are 4 layers in the hibernate architecture:
                    
                    Java application layer
                    Hibernate framework layer
                    Backend API layer
                    Database layer</p>
                <br/>
                <p>For creating the first application, we need to know the elements of hibernate architecture, they are as follows:

                    SessionFactory: The SessionFactory is a factory of session and client of ConnectionProvider.It holds a second level cache(optional) of data. This provides a factory method to obtain a session object.
                    Session: The session object provides an interface between the application and data stored into the database. It holds first level cache(mandatory) of data.
                    Java Applications can use the Hibernate framework as the persistence layer for storing and retrieving plain old java objects(POJos) to/from a relational database. Hibernate is a persistence framework that provides tools for object relational mapping(ORM)</p></li>
                <li> Java Messaging Service (JMS)</li>
                <li> Java Security</li>
                <li>Java Design Patterns</li>
            </ul>
