        <h1>What is Data?</h1>
            <p>In simple words, data can be facts related to any object in consideration. For example, your name, age, height, weight, etc. are some data related to you. A picture, image, file, pdf, etc. can also be considered data.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>What is Database?</h2>
        <p>A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronic storage and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy.

            Let us discuss a database example: An online telephone directory uses a database to store data of people, phone numbers, and other contact details. Your electricity service provider uses a database to manage billing, client-related issues, handle fault data, etc.
            
            Let us also consider Facebook. It needs to store, manipulate, and present data related to members, their friends, member activities, messages, advertisements, and a lot more. We can provide a countless number of examples for the usage of databases.</p>

         <h3>Types of Databases</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><h5>Distributed databases</h5>
                <p>A distributed database is a type of database that has contributions from the common database and information captured by local computers. In this type of database system, the data is not in one place and is distributed at various organizations.</p></li>
           
            <li><h5>Relational databases</h5>
                <p>This type of database defines database relationships in the form of tables. It is also called Relational DBMS, which is the most popular DBMS type in the market. Database example of the RDBMS system include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server database.</p></li>
                
            <li><h5>Object-oriented databases</h5>
                <p>This type of computers database supports the storage of all data types. The data is stored in the form of objects. The objects to be held in the database have attributes and methods that define what to do with the data. PostgreSQL is an example of an object-oriented relational DBMS.</p></li>

            <li><h5>NoSQL databases</h5>
                <p>NoSQL database is used for large sets of distributed data. There are a few big data performance problems that are effectively handled by relational databases. This type of computers database is very efficient in analyzing large-size unstructured data.</p></li>
   
            <li><h5>Personal database</h5>
                <p>A personal database is used to store data stored on personal computers that are smaller and easily manageable. The data is mostly used by the same department of the company and is accessed by a small group of people.</p></li>
