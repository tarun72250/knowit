            <h2>Section One Food</h2>
            <p>No matter the perks of today’s city lifestyle, there always comes a time where we want to take a step back and slow down. One of the things we are naturally drawn to is nature, as it is in our instinct to be connected with our natural roots as our ancestors did. Nothing beats the feeling of the grass grazing your feet as you walk or hearing the sound of the ocean waves crashing by the shore, or even seeing the carpet of stars in a clear night sky.</p>

            <p>“God is discovered entirely through creation – the brilliance of a sunset, the powerful roar of a waterfall, the symphony of sounds you hear in the heart of the forest, or the vastness of space and its countless stars.” — Benjamin Sullivan</p>
